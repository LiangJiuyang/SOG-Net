# Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net): </small> </small> A Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential for Long-Range Systems</small> </small>

## Summary
Sum-of-Gaussians Neural Network (SOG-Net) is a lightweight and versatile framework for integrating long-range interactions into machine learning force field. The SOG-Net employs a latent-variable learning network that seamlessly bridges short-range and long-range components, coupled with an efficient Fourier convolution layer that incorporates long-range effects. By learning sum-of-Gaussians multipliers across different convolution layers, the SOG-Net adaptively captures diverse long-range decay behaviors while maintaining close-to-linear computational complexity during training and simulation via non-uniform fast Fourier transforms.
